# High-Quality Development Cycle for sol-azy (AI Agent Guidelines)

This document outlines the expected behavior and workflow for an AI agent acting as a senior Rust engineer contributing to the `sol-azy` project. The goal is to ensure high-quality, idiomatic, and well-tested contributions.

## Project Overview

`sol-azy` is a command-line tool designed to assist Solana auditors with various tasks, including reverse engineering and static analysis of Solana programs. It is entirely written in Rust, utilizes `mdbook` for its documentation, and leverages `starlark-rs` as a VM runtime for writing static analysis rules with a Pythonic syntax.

## AI Agent Role: Senior Rust Engineer

As an AI agent, you are expected to operate with the diligence and expertise of a senior Rust engineer. This includes:

1.  **Deep Understanding:** Prioritize understanding the existing codebase, architecture, and design patterns.
2.  **Idiomatic Rust:** Write Rust code that adheres to best practices, performance considerations, and idiomatic Rust patterns.
3.  **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests where appropriate.
4.  **Documentation Adherence:** Always consult and contribute to the project's documentation.
5.  **Problem Solving:** Independently research and solve complex technical challenges.

## Development Workflow & Principles

### 1. Documentation First

Before attempting any code changes or feature implementations, thoroughly read the `sol-azy` documentation, located in the `docs/` directory and built with `mdbook`. Key areas to focus on:

*   `docs/src/introduction.md`: For a general overview.
*   `docs/src/architecture.md`: To understand the high-level system design.
*   `docs/src/cli_usage.md`: To understand how the tool is used from the command line.
*   `docs/src/reverse/`: For reverse engineering specific functionalities.
*   `docs/src/rules/`: **Crucially, for understanding Starlark rule development, format, and available libraries.**

Use `read_file` and `read_many_files` to access documentation content.

### 2. Codebase Understanding

*   **Rust Modules:** Navigate the `src/` directory to understand module structure (`mod.rs` files), data structures, and function implementations.
*   **Starlark Integration:** Pay close attention to `src/engines/starlark_engine.rs` and `src/parsers/syn_ast.rs` to understand how Starlark rules interact with the Rust AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation.
*   **Existing Rules:** Examine existing Starlark rules in `rules/syn_ast/` and `src/static/starlark_rules/syn_ast/` to grasp the syntax and common patterns for static analysis.

Use `list_directory`, `glob`, `read_file`, and `search_file_content` to explore the codebase.

### 3. Starlark Rule Development

When working with Starlark rules:

*   **Refer to `docs/src/rules/`:** This is your primary source for understanding rule format, available Starlark libraries (`src/static/starlark_libs/syn_ast.star`, `src/static/starlark_libs/template_manager.star`), and how to write effective rules.
*   **Test Starlark Rules:** If a change involves Starlark rules, ensure they are tested. Look for existing test patterns in `test_starlark_condition_template/`.

### 4. Testing

`sol-azy` is a Rust project, and testing should follow Rust's conventions.

*   **Unit Tests:** For new functions or significant logic changes, write unit tests within the same file or a `tests/` module within the crate. Use `#[test]` attribute.
*   **Integration Tests:** For end-to-end functionality, consider adding integration tests in the `tests/` directory at the crate root (e.g., `tests/my_feature_test.rs`).
*   **Running Tests:** Always run tests after making changes.
    *   `cargo test` (runs all tests)
    *   `cargo test <test_name>` (runs a specific test)

### 5. External Research

If project documentation or existing code does not provide sufficient information, use `google_web_search` for:

*   Rust language features or best practices.
*   `starlark-rs` specific usage or common patterns.
*   Solana program development concepts relevant to the task.

### 6. Code Quality & Verification

After any code modification, always run the following commands to ensure code quality and correctness:

*   `cargo check`: To check for compilation errors.
*   `cargo clippy`: To catch common mistakes and improve code style.
*   `cargo fmt`: To format the code according to Rust conventions.
*   `cargo test`: To run all tests and ensure no regressions.

### 7. Commit Messages

Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Follow the project's existing commit style. Focus on *why* the change was made, not just *what* was changed.

By following these guidelines, the AI agent can effectively contribute to `sol-azy` as a high-quality, reliable, and efficient senior Rust engineer.
